# Setting Up Development Environment for React App using Vite

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create a New React Project

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React project using Vite:

```sh
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn:

```sh
yarn create vite my-react-app --template react
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```sh
cd my-react-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Or with Yarn:

```sh
yarn
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or with Yarn:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and you can view your application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

### 5. Building for Production

To create a production build of your React app, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

Or with Yarn:

```sh
yarn build
```

This will generate a `dist` directory containing the production build of your app.

### 6. Preview the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, you can use the following command:

```sh
npm run serve
```

Or with Yarn:

```sh
yarn serve
```

This will serve the contents of the `dist` directory at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Additional Configuration

### TypeScript

If you want to use TypeScript, you can create a new project with the TypeScript template:

```sh
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react-ts
```

Or with Yarn:

```sh
yarn create vite my-react-app --template react-ts
```

### ESLint and Prettier

To add ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting, you can follow these steps:

1. Install ESLint and Prettier:

     ```sh
     npm install eslint prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier --save-dev
     ```

     Or with Yarn:

     ```sh
     yarn add eslint prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier --dev
     ```

2. Create an `.eslintrc.js` file in the root of your project with the following content:

     ```js
     module.exports = {
       extends: ['react-app', 'plugin:prettier/recommended'],
       rules: {
          // Add your custom rules here
       },
     };
     ```

3. Create a `.prettierrc` file in the root of your project with the following content:

     ```json
     {
       "singleQuote": true,
       "trailingComma": "all"
     }
     ```

## Conclusion

You have now set up a development environment for a React app using Vite. You can start building your application and take advantage of Vite's fast build times and hot module replacement.
